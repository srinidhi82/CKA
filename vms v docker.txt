DOcker runs on a OS Kernel , OS Kernel helps inreaction between OS and Hardware like RAM,memory CPU etc
apps run on Kernel layer.

Docker virtualise apps layer uses Kernel of the host
VMS's virtualises complete OS

Size docker smallest
======================OS==============
OS  diff sets like ubuntu,fedora,centos, but they all have same OS kernel which is linux. 
The softare above the linux kernel differentiates the diff operating systems. compilers,file mangers etc 

===================================================
The kernel is a computer program at the core of a computer's operating system and 
generally has complete control over everything in the system. 
It is the portion of the operating system code that is always resident 
in memory and facilitates interactions between hardware and software components.
 helps with tasks such as process and memory management, file systems, device control and networking

 Application 

OS Kernel 

CPU   Memory  Devices
It provides the interfaces needed for users and applications to interact with the computer.
It launches and manages applications.
It manages the underlying system hardware devices.

================

COntainers isolaated environments where apps are hosted on it by docker engine
containers have their own processes, networks and mounts , each container running on a OS or a VM all sare same OS kernel
