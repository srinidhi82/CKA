K8s host apps in foirm of containers as easily can be deplyed
Container orchestration - automated way of deplpoying and managing the conyaineres apps
Too many containers to manage the apps and scale up and down the containers is a tedious way to manage the apps so k8's will help manage and deploy containerised apps
customized devs - supported on azzure and aws 

apps are run on kultiple instances using nodes on K8's 

===================
POD - it is a smallest object in a kubernetets ckuster which si spun on a worker node or if it is a single node cluster on that node. POD is an object where the container consisting of a docker image where the apps are built is deployed

PODS have a 1:1 relationship with the containers and thats how apps are scaled
